About 
I'm Svitlana Pankiv and I'm currently a student in Code the Dream School based in the US. 
My career goals are to become a web developer and create convenient, high-quality, and good-looking websites. I would like to work in environments such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I would like to have control to create, enhance and modify websites. 

My way to coding journey started unexpectedly when I went to the US. I need to choose a new field of study and some friends found for me some course JS syntax. I was so excited when I was able to write small code, that I decide to continue my studies in this area.
Outside of work and studying I like to have time with my family, try some delicious food, also my passion is coffee and reading.
