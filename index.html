            <h2>My way</h2>
            <p>My way to coding journey started unexpectedly when I went to the US. I need to choose a new field of study and some friends found for me some course JS syntax. I was so excited when I was able to write small code, that I decide to continue my studies in this area.Outside of work and studying I like to have time with my family, try some delicious food, also my passion is coffee and reading.</p>
